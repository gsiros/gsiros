### Hello

I dig computers, part-time code and full-time learn.

I am a PhD student at Northeastern University, Boston. My research interest lies in securing systems that incorporate Machine Learning as a core component within a larger pipeline.

Check out my collaborators **and** (proudly!) very good friends; we have worked together in most of my projects. Alphabetically:
