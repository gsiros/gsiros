### Hello

My name is Georgios (also spelled Yorgos, pronounced Yor-ghos). I dig computers, part-time code and full-time learn.

I am a PhD candidate at Northeastern University, Boston. My work spans Trustworthy AI and Distributed & Decentralized Machine Learning systems. My research interest lies in securing systems that incorporate Artificial Intelligence as a core component within a larger pipeline.
